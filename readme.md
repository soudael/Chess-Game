[Chess Game]

About
{
    Chess is a strategic board game played between two players. The goal is to checkmate the opponent's king by using different pieces, each with unique movements, on a 64-square 8x8 board.

    This code is made by a still-learning programmer. Therefore, there is no advanced coding or structures. The code is entirely based on C language, running only in terminal (currently).

    Maybe in the future I'm going to add some front-end to it.
